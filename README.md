 ### Purpose & Contents
 This repository's purpose is to hold different swift language **array** *problems* and thier *solutions* for anyone interested in seeing or editing them.
 
 ### Why Check It Out?
 The code and solutions to these problems might guide you in the right direction on other problems that you are stuck on! Maybe you have better solutions to these same problems that you would like to share!
 
 ### Organization
Problems from [Coding Bat Array-1](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-1) are grouped together as well as those for [Array-2](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2) and [Array-3](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-3). There are two prime number problems from Project Euler that have files of their own: [Problem 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17) and [Project 10](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10).

#### In Partnership
I helped Patrick with his [repository](https://github.com/liltowel/Project5CSC509PatrickAlston) by providing him with a template for his [README](https://github.com/liltowel/Project5CSC509PatrickAlston/blob/master/README.md) as well as changing his testing array length from '4' to '3' in his [Problem 5](https://github.com/liltowel/Project5CSC509PatrickAlston/blob/master/Question%20Five.playground/Contents.swift).
